# Bug's Life Cycle 

Open -> Resolved -> Closed or Reopened  

- **Open:** tester create an issue 
- **Resolved:** developer fix the issue
- **Closed:** tester review the issue resolved and all is ok
- **Reopened:** tester review the issue resolved and some is not ok

# Bug's status, tags and categories:
Issues/Bugs should have categories or tags to know their importance, impact and how fast it should be resolved.  

### Closed Status
If an issue is closed, there is a second status to explain why it was closed:
- Closed - Fixed
- Closed - Invalid
- Closed - Wontfix
- Closed - Worksforme

### Bug Severity
Level of Impact that the bug has on the software or to use it.  
- Critical
- Major
- Medium
- Minor
- Enhancement
- Nice to have

### Bug Priority
Order to resolve an issue  
- High
- Medium
- Low

All these statuses sometimes are configured by the bug tracking tool (Taiga, Bugzilla, etc.), however, there are many tools where they can be customized (Github issues, JIRA tags, etc.)
