## Fundamental QA Metrics

Sprint / Release **absolute metrics**:  
Each sprint or release we should have a summary of test results, test execution and bug tracking, general or by feature, using this metrics: 

- Test cases (total, passed, failed, blocked, by feature)
- Sprint Issues (total, open, reopened, resolved, closed, severity/priority)
- Production Issues (total, severity/priority) - 2 weeks after functional / regression week
- Design Time (functional test cases, regression test cases)
- Execution Time (functional test cases, regression test cases)

These metrics can be used in tables, charts, etc.    

If we want to be more accuracy, **derivative metrics** are better, absolute metric are included here and all are represented by equations with percentages results, charts more detailed than absolute metrics: 

- Test Tracking and Efficiency
- Test Effectiveness
- Test Coverage
- Test Effort
- Test Team Metrics
- Test Execution Status
- Defect Distribution Charts
... etc.
